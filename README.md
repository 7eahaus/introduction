# TeaHaus Shindan
## Introduction
Hi, my name is TeaHaus Shindan, an online alias to protect my real name. I'm a self-taught writer, artist, and aspiring web designer and developer. I have skills in HTML and CSS, and I'm currently learning a little JavaScript. I'm 27 years old, based in Michigan, USA living with my husband and 3 black cats. My hobbies include playing video games, writing, drawing, and learning about coding.
## Learning
I'm currently using a combination of [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and classes at my local community college to learn more about coding and website development. Even the free version of W3 Schools is invaluable to me; all the lessons are free to access and have examples of use cases. You can also play around in their "spaces", a sandbox with the ability to preview what your page will look like. I also use Visual Studio Code as my text editor, as the theme colors help me understand what I'm looking at and that I make sure to close my tags properly.
## Notetaking
I currently use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for all my notetaking and I'm currently working on learning how to use the [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) plugin to it's fullest.
I highly reccomend looking into Obsidian because it's a great way to organize your notes and make connections between them. Obsidian works in Markdown files and stores them locally so you can't lose your data to a cloud. There is, however, a paid sync option if you want to be able to access your notes on multiple devices.
