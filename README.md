# TeaHaus Shindan
Hi, my name is TeaHaus Shindan, an online alias to protect my real name. I'm a self-taught writer, artist, and aspiring web designer and developer. I have skills in HTML and CSS, and I'm currently learning a little JavaScript. I'm 26 years old, based in Michigan, USA living with my husband and 3 black cats. My hobbies include playing video games, writing, drawing, and learning about coding.
